# UTPB-COSC-3310-Project1
This repo contains the assignment and provided code base for Project 1 of the Digital Computer Organization class.

The provided UInt class contains the skeleton of a Java class which handles unsigned integers, using an array of boolean values to store a binary representation of a positive integer value.

The goal of the project is to complete the class by filling out each of the methods marked with a // TODO comment.  There should be plenty of code present for the toInt() and add() methods to help you understand how to proceed.

For full credit, your code will need to pass the battery of unit tests provided in the Test class.

The grading criteria is:
* If your code fails to compile, the grade is zero.
* If your code encounters an unhandled exception and crashes, the grade is zero.
* For every unit test passed (assuming no crashes), you gain around 2 points.  The mul() methods will be weighted slightly more heavily.
* If your code passes every test, that's 100.
